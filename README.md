# Productionizing-Iris-ML-algorithm
This project hosts a RandomForest prediction algorithm to distinguish different types of Iris's flowers using leaf sizes. The algorithm is hosted on a RESTful API using flask

1. The air.py script runs the flask api
2. The model in the ipynd designs the model,and saves to memory using pickle
3. The pickled model is called by the API
